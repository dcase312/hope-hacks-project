# Tutor U Charlotte Hope Hacks Project

## Summary of Service
Tutor U Charlotte is a non-profit organization that connectes the parents of Charlotte elementary schoolers with free tuition and transportation to one of our partner tutoring centers. Sign up for our services is done through the site via the contact page where user information gets stored in a MySQL database. On the map page, a 3rd party API is used to calculate distance between whatever address the user puts in and the tutoring center of their choosing which auto-selects when they click on the corresponding pin on the map.
