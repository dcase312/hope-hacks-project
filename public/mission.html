                    <p class="c1-text">Out of all of America's largest cities, Charlotte ranks 50/50 in Upward Mobility. This means that in Charlotte, people born
                    in poverty have a harder time getting out of poverty than those in any other large American city. This is a systemic issues as low-income communities
                    don't have the funds or access to advance in society, and consequently get trapped in a cycle of poverty.

                    <p class="c1-text">Schools in low-income communities don't receive the funding necessary to cultivate the talents and 
                    development of students. Research shows that students who read on grade level by third grade are 96% more likely to graduate 
                    high school but only 39% of CMS third graders are reading on grade level.

                    parents and guardians of elementary students with tutoring centers who specialize in K-5 education. Everything we do  
                    is a reflection of our core beliefs:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Personal development, opportunity, and support empowers students to reach their full potential</li>
                        <li>Diversity and inclusion fuels success and necessary change</li>
                        <li>Challenging practices, structures, and policies realizes educational equity</li>

                    <h2 class="c2-title">Our Mission</h2>
                    <p class="c2-text">Tutor U Charlotte seeks to end the cycle of poverty and stagnant upward mobility by targeting the educational development of elementary 
                    students to build a strong foundation for their educational careers. We believe that everyone should have equal access 
                    to opportunities through education. With the help of our sponsors and community, we provide students grades K-5 who 
                    are in under-funded schools with free access to one-on-one tutoring as an after-school educational supplement. 
                    Through everyone's combined efforts, we hope to end educational inequity one student at a time.</p>
